# Instructions for adding the terminal screenshot

To add your terminal screenshot to the README:

1. Save your terminal screenshot as "terminal-demo.png" in this images/ directory
2. The screenshot should show:
   - The main terminal interface with green text on black background
   - The system monitoring sidebar showing CPU, Memory, and Disk usage
   - Some example commands being executed
   - The modern UI with the Python Command Terminal header

3. Recommended image specifications:
   - Format: PNG (for better quality with transparency)
   - Resolution: 1200x600 pixels or similar 2:1 ratio
   - File size: Under 2MB for faster loading

4. After adding the image, commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add images/terminal-demo.png
   git commit -m "Add terminal demo screenshot"
   git push
   ```

The README is already configured to display ./images/terminal-demo.png
